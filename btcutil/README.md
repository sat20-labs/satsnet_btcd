Package btcutil provides bitcoin-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.  See
`test_coverage.txt` for the gocov coverage report.  Alternatively, if you are
running a POSIX OS, you can run the `cov_report.sh` script for a real-time
report.

This package was developed for btcd, an alternative full-node implementation of
bitcoin which is under active development by Conformal.  Although it was
primarily written for btcd, this package has intentionally been designed so it
can be used as a standalone package for any projects needing the functionality
provided.
